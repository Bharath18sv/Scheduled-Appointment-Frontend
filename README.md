## 🏗️ Expected Architecture

We're evaluating your ability to structure frontend code following modern patterns:

### Must Demonstrate

1. **Headless Components / Custom Hooks**

   ```typescript
   // Separate business logic from UI
   function useAppointmentScheduler(doctorId: string, date: Date) {
     // Logic here
     return { appointments, timeSlots, loading, error };
   }
   ```

2. **Service Layer**

   ```typescript
   // Abstract data access
   class AppointmentService {
     getAppointmentsByDoctorAndDate(
       doctorId: string,
       date: Date
     ): Appointment[];
   }
   ```

3. **Composable Components**

   ```tsx
   <ScheduleView>
     <ScheduleHeader />
     <TimelineGrid />
     <AppointmentList />
   </ScheduleView>
   ```

4. **Domain Models (Optional but Encouraged)**
   ```typescript
   class TimeSlot {
     constructor(public start: Date, public end: Date) {}
     overlaps(other: TimeSlot): boolean {}
   }
   ```

## 🎉 **PROJECT COMPLETED!**

### ✅ **Architecture Decisions**

**1. Service Layer Pattern**

- Implemented `AppointmentService` class to abstract data access
- Clean separation between data layer and business logic
- Easy to mock for testing and replace with real API calls later

**2. Headless Hook Pattern**

- `useAppointments` hook encapsulates all business logic
- Components are purely presentational
- Reusable logic that can be shared between DayView and WeekView

**3. Component Composition**

- `ScheduleView` orchestrates all child components
- `DayView` and `WeekView` are specialized calendar renderers
- `AppointmentCard` is a reusable component with compact mode
- `DoctorSelector` is a self-contained dropdown component

**4. TypeScript-First Design**

- Comprehensive type definitions in `types/index.ts`
- Strong typing throughout the application
- No `any` types used anywhere

### 🏗️ **Component Structure**

```
ScheduleView (Main Orchestrator)
├── DoctorSelector (Doctor Selection)
├── DayView (Single Day Timeline)
│   └── AppointmentCard (Individual Appointments)
└── WeekView (7-Day Grid)
    └── AppointmentCard (Compact Mode)
```

**Data Flow:**

```
MockData → AppointmentService → useAppointments → Components
```

### 🎨 **Visual Features Implemented**

- **Color Coding**: Each appointment type has distinct colors (blue, green, orange, purple)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile with horizontal scroll
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators while fetching data
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages when data fails to load
- **Empty States**: Shows helpful messages when no appointments exist

## 💡 Hints & Tips

### Time Slot Generation

```typescript
// Generate 30-minute time slots from 8 AM to 6 PM
function generateTimeSlots(date: Date): TimeSlot[] {
  const slots = [];
  for (let hour = 8; hour < 18; hour++) {
    for (let minute of [0, 30]) {
      const start = new Date(date);
      start.setHours(hour, minute, 0, 0);
      // ...
    }
  }
  return slots;
}
```

### Appointment Positioning

```typescript
// Find appointments that fit in a specific time slot
function getAppointmentsForSlot(
  appointments: Appointment[],
  slotStart: Date
): Appointment[] {
  return appointments.filter((apt) => {
    const aptStart = new Date(apt.startTime);
    const aptEnd = new Date(apt.endTime);
    // Does appointment overlap with this slot?
  });
}
```

### Date Utilities

Consider using `date-fns` (already in package.json):

```typescript
import { format, addDays, isSameDay } from "date-fns";
```
