# Hospital Appointment Scheduler - Submission

## üéØ **Project Completion Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

All core requirements have been successfully implemented and the application is fully functional.

---

## üìã **Core Requirements Completed**

### ‚úÖ **1. Architecture & Design (30%)**

- **Service Layer**: Implemented `AppointmentService` class for data access abstraction
- **Headless Hooks**: Created `useAppointments` hook separating business logic from UI
- **Component Composition**: Built reusable, composable components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean architecture with distinct layers

### ‚úÖ **2. Day View Calendar (25%)**

- Time slots from 8 AM to 6 PM (30-minute intervals)
- Appointments positioned correctly in their time slots
- Patient name, appointment type, and duration displayed
- Color-coded by appointment type using `APPOINTMENT_TYPE_CONFIG`
- Handles overlapping appointments gracefully

### ‚úÖ **3. Week View Calendar (25%)**

- 7-day grid layout (Monday through Sunday)
- Same time range as day view (8 AM - 6 PM)
- Appointments positioned correctly by day and time
- Responsive design with horizontal scroll on mobile
- Compact appointment cards for better space utilization

### ‚úÖ **4. Role-Based Filtering (20%)**

- Doctor dropdown selector with name and specialty
- Displays doctor's name, specialty, and working hours
- Filters appointments by selected doctor
- Defaults to first doctor on page load

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Implementation**

### **Service Layer Pattern**

```typescript
// Clean data access abstraction
export class AppointmentService {
  getAppointmentsByDoctor(doctorId: string): Appointment[];
  getAppointmentsByDoctorAndDate(doctorId: string, date: Date): Appointment[];
  getAppointmentsByDoctorAndDateRange(
    doctorId: string,
    startDate: Date,
    endDate: Date
  ): Appointment[];
  // ... other methods
}
```

### **Headless Hook Pattern**

```typescript
// Business logic separated from UI
export function useAppointments(
  params: UseAppointmentsParams
): UseAppointmentsReturn {
  // Handles loading, error states, data fetching
  // Reusable for both day and week views
}
```

### **Component Composition**

```
ScheduleView (Main Orchestrator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DoctorSelector (Doctor Selection)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DayView (Single Day Timeline)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AppointmentCard (Individual Appointments)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WeekView (7-Day Grid)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AppointmentCard (Compact Mode)
```

## üé® **Visual Features Implemented**

### **Color Coding System**

- **Checkup**: Blue (#3b82f6)
- **Consultation**: Green (#10b981)
- **Follow-up**: Orange (#f59e0b)
- **Procedure**: Purple (#8b5cf6)

### **Responsive Design**

- Desktop: Full-width calendar with optimal spacing

- Efficient appointment overlap detection
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays

### **Type Safety**

- Comprehensive TypeScript implementation
- No `any` types used anywhere
- Strong typing throughout the application
- Interface-driven development
